Here's a brand **new fashion AI project topic** with complete code, feature explanations, and steps to run in **VS Code** and deploy on **GitHub** or **Streamlit Cloud**:

---

## 👗 **TrendWeaver AI** – Fabric Pattern Classifier & Outfit Composer

---

### 📌 **Project Summary**

**TrendWeaver AI** is a smart fashion assistant that classifies fabric patterns from uploaded clothing images and suggests complementary outfit ideas based on detected pattern types (e.g., floral, striped, solid, checked, etc.).

## 📜 `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image
import torch
from torchvision import transforms
import random, json
from fpdf import FPDF
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Page setup
st.set_page_config(page_title="TrendWeaver AI", layout="wide")
st.title("👗 TrendWeaver AI – Fabric Pattern Classifier & Outfit Composer")

# Load pattern suggestions
with open("data/outfit_suggestions.json") as f:
    pattern_ideas = json.load(f)

pattern_types = list(pattern_ideas.keys())

# Dummy model logic
def predict_pattern(image):
    return random.choice(pattern_types)

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor()
])

# Download PDF lookbook
def generate_lookbook(pattern, suggestions):
    pdf = FPDF()
    pdf.add_page()
    pdf.set_font("Arial", size=12)
    pdf.cell(200, 10, f"Lookbook for {pattern} Patterns", ln=True)
    pdf.ln()
    for item in suggestions:
        pdf.cell(200, 10, f"- {item}", ln=True)
    path = "lookbook.pdf"
    pdf.output(path)
    return path

# Pattern knowledge base
descriptions = {
    "floral": "Often used in spring and summer, floral patterns bring freshness and femininity.",
    "striped": "A versatile design used in both casual and formal wear for a clean look.",
    "solid": "Timeless and universal. Perfect for pairing with bold accessories or prints.",
    "polka dots": "Playful and retro. A pattern often seen in vintage styles.",
    "checked": "Common in winter fashion and associated with flannel or tartan designs."
}

# Upload section
uploaded_images = st.file_uploader("Upload up to 3 outfit/fabric images", type=["jpg", "png"], accept_multiple_files=True)

pattern_counter = st.session_state.get("pattern_count", {})

if uploaded_images:
    for img_file in uploaded_images:
        img = Image.open(img_file).convert("RGB")
        st.image(img, caption="Uploaded Image", use_column_width=True)

        predicted = predict_pattern(img)
        st.success(f"🧵 Detected Pattern: **{predicted.upper()}**")

        # Count for chart
        pattern_counter[predicted] = pattern_counter.get(predicted, 0) + 1
        st.session_state.pattern_count = pattern_counter

        # Explanation
        st.info(f"🧠 About `{predicted}`: {descriptions.get(predicted, 'No info')}")

        # Outfit Suggestions
        st.subheader("👚 Suggested Outfit Items")
        outfit = pattern_ideas[predicted]
        st.write(", ".join(outfit))

        # Download Lookbook
        path = generate_lookbook(predicted, outfit)
        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            st.download_button("📥 Download Lookbook PDF", f, file_name="lookbook.pdf")

# Trend chart
if pattern_counter:
    st.subheader("📊 Most Common Patterns (this session)")
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.bar(pattern_counter.keys(), pattern_counter.values(), color='salmon')

   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Launch:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

---

## 🚀 Deployment

* Push to GitHub
* Deploy on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) using the repo URL

---

## ✅ What You Get

* Pattern classifier (mock logic, replaceable with real CNN)
* Visual clothing suggestions
* Lookbook PDF generation
* Trend chart
* Fun and educational fashion insights

Would you like this zipped and GitHub-ready? Or should I generate **another idea** with different features (e.g., virtual try-on, color matcher, fashion quiz)?
